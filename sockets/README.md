# Socket programming

Socket programming involves a client and a server operating at the TCP/IP transport-layer.
Two standards of socket programming are used: the datagram-based protocol User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the stream-based protocol Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

These standards differ mainly in their reliability.
UDP is more susceptible to dropping packets as it is a "connection-less" protocol.
As such, it exposes the shortcomings of the network it uses as packets can be dropped.
