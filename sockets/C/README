# How big is a character in C?

Guaranteed to be exactly 1 byte, meaning 8 bits (unless your architecture has different byte lengths which is rare).

# What is IPC?

Inter-process communication is the situation where processes communicate with one another and share data
over a common communication protocol.
Typically the setup includes a client and server, where one requests data and the other responds.

# What are file descriptors?

When a new file is open, it is associated with a _file descriptor_, an integer that is effectively an index into the
array of open files by the kernel.

3 file descriptors are always open:

- 0, stdin
- 1, stdout
- 2, stderr

The `open` function allocates sufficient resources to open a file and associates it with a file descriptor, which it returns.

```C
int fd = open("~/Project/tmp.txt");
```

The `read` function takes a file descriptor and reads a number of bytes into a buffer.

```C
int b = read(fd, &input, count);
```
